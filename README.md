- Change the height to `2px` and the color of the card border to `#e8f1fc` inside the news content to increase visibility while maintaining the main focus on the news content.
- Add a shadow of `0 -29px 111px rgba(45, 55, 94, 0.47)` when the navbar is scrolled to create separation between the navbar and the page.
